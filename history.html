                        <h2>2000</h2>
                        <p>While practicing one day in late January of 2000, Gil came up with a riff and then was made into the song "This One".
                        February 26, 2000, at Voodoo Lounge in Bayside, Queens, Season opened up a show with N.Y.H.C. bands, 12 Step Program, Through The Discipline, Slugfest, Diesel, Diecast, and Sworn Enemy.  Although they are not a hardcore band, few (and I mean FEW) people liked Season, other then their friends who had shown up.  After their 5 song set, there was some disagreements and both Danny and Gil quit the band.
                        Days later, after talking out the situation and getting things straight, Danny rejoined Season. So now they plan on writing more new material and getting their demo finished (finally)    
                        After some changing up and talking about new things to do within the band, Greg and Raff switched instruments leaving Raff on bass and Greg on guitar.  Gil decided that he needs time off from the band and if he decides to join later on, it will be up to the rest of the members of the band for the decision.  Since the band has been changing a lot, they decided that they needed a new band name.  After talking through many ideas for names, the band decided on Rich's old internet name Greykill.
                        A few months later after writing some newer material and planning to book some shows, it was decided that the band needed a new name since not everyone in the band was for Greykill.  Alex came up with the name Edefstry and it stuck and they are now called that.
                        In August of 2000, bassist Raff left the band to move to college in Vermont.  Edefstry currently does not have a bassist but are looking for one.  In September, Edefstry recruited Alejandro Torres onto second guitar.  But only after 2 practices and not good equipment, Alejandro quit.
                        In December, due to personal issues, Alex Rivera left the band.  Now with only 3 members and still searching for more, Edefstry is still striving forward and not letting anything hold them back.</p>

                        <h2>1999</h2>
                        <p>Early Feb. 1999, Rich decided that Season should play a show at Funkadelic Studios on Valentines Day for free.  So after good friend Gil Vasquez booked studio time and all, Season decided to finally play their first show.  Having only a few friends attending, they felt it was a decent first show for them.  Since they were excited about the show, they decided to play again later on that week there.  But this time charging a dollar so they can pay for studio time.  The second show, they had brought in more friends and energy as well.  Their friends were really into them and Season had a good vibe that kept them moving to work on more music for them to play at their next show.
                        After a month and a half of learning more cover songs and writing 'Push', Season felt it was time for another show.  Joe talked to some of the people in his old band Jynx and got them to open up for Season at Funkadelic Studios on April 3, 1999.  Since it was Jynxs first show, they brought in many people, as well as Season, making it a packed show.  After Jynx played, Season whipped through a 14 song set featuring originals 'Rage', 'Upper Class', and debuting 'Push', and cover songs from the Deftones featuring guest vocals on 'Be Quiet and Drive' by Alejandro of Dysintary.
                        Afterwards, a few weeks later, they dropped their songs 'Rage' and 'Upper Class'.  A month and a half later, due to musical differences, Joe decided to quit Season.  Before he quit he wanted to play one last show with them as a 'Goodbye Show'.  The Battle of the Bands at Art and Design High School where Rich and Raff attended was Joes last show with Season.  Opening acts were bands such as Enrapture, Dysintary, Saints Drowning, X-S, and others.  There were many, many people at this show, mostly for Season and Enrapture.  While performing, many people crowded the stage such as Season, friends of Season and other people that no one in Season knew.
                        In mid June of 99, Rich came up with an idea and lyrics for a song that he really wanted to work on.  So after explaining his ideas about it, everyone in the band, with the exception of Pat, began working on it.  After it was finished Rich called it 'Get Off My Dick', in reference to a girl who stole his Soulfly cd.
                        In early July of 99, while playing a private party at a friends house in Long Island, Danny, Rich, and Greg discussed about having friend Gil Vasquez replacing Pat on guitar.  After discussing it, they decided to recruit Gil in the band.  At one of the first practices Gil had with the band, he introduced a riff of his to the band and then they worked on it.  After adding vocals and finishing it, they called it 'Pre Me'.  Later on in July, Greg got a phone call from Dave of Jynx and he told Greg about a show that they were putting together on August 13 at S.O.S Studios with another band.  Greg told everyone else in Season and they were added on to the bill as the opening act.  The day of the show, the place packed filled with all kinds of people, and Season started things off, and this too was Gils first show with Season.  So they played through a very quick 5 song set and weren't very pleased with it.  It wasn't really all that much of a good show for the members of Season.
                        In early September, Rich got a call from Fabian of Enrapture, and he told Rich that Enrapture was playing Castle Heights on September 11 and he wanted Season to play.  Rich told everyone in the band and a few days later played a quick 6 songs set, 3 songs being Deftones songs and the other 3 being all the Season songs.  It was a very short set and very unexpected as well, since the band found out about the show 2 days ahead of time.
                        A couple of weeks later, Rich had talked to Alex Rivera and decided to bring him into Season on vocals along with Rich.  Also at this point Gil had introduced a new riff to the band and they worked on it, also giving Alex the chance to help creating the song.  After the writing process was finished, it was named 'Filth'.
                        Early November, Joe Delgado and his new band, 12 Step Program, got Season a show at Castle Heights with Full Blown Chaos and 2 other bands.  Since they had a new member and a new song, Season felt that they were gonna have a good show.  They had a good show, although it was a very short one, playing only 5 songs and half of a Tool cover.  After not coming to practice for the next month after the show, Alex quit Season due to personal reasons.  Although it seemed like a great loss, it was made into a positive attribute.  It gave Rich the chance to put more creativity into the lyrics and less practice time would be wasted on teaching someone else the different parts in the songs.
                        In mid to late December, Greg came up with a few riffs and showed them to the band and everyone worked on it.  Everyone felt that this was the better songs Season has had.  Rich called it 'Choke' due to the chorus lyrics "You can't choke me this time."
                        After a creativity block to writing new material, Season decided to make a demo tape with the songs that they had so far and not to sit around and wait to write a new song before recording the demo.  So far the demo is still being worked on and will not be finished for at least another month or so.
                        After being out of the band for a month and a half, co-vocalist Alex rejoined Season singing along with Rich.
                        Since there were many recording troubles happening, they never got around to making the tape.  Instead they decided to try writing new material.</p>

                   <div class="year98">
                        <h2>1998</h2>
                        <p>In mid 1998, after the break up of the band Tri-X, brothers Raff and Danny Sardi and Raffs school friend Rich Claudio decided to start a new band. They brought in good friend Pat Divine on bass.  Since they had all the musicians in the band, they came up with the band name Linus. Then the next thing was to find a singer for the band. Good friend Alex Rivera was brought into the band as the vocalist.  They mainly first off started playing Korn cover songs.  One day while playing, neighborhood acquaintance Joe Delgado stopped by and was hanging out with them.  Then when they started playing Joe got up and started singing along with the band.  Linus really liked Joe and wanted him to join the band.  After telling Alex that they want Joe to sing along with Alex, he then quit the band.  So Joe became the official vocalist.
                        After about a month or so when Joe joined the band that they decided to get a replacement for Pat.  Joe brought in good friend Greg Scott for an audition.  After the audition, Greg joined the band and replaced Pat on bass, and Pat therefore became the second vocalist, sharing roles with Joe.  A few weeks later, Rich and Pat switched positions, meaning Pat was now playing guitar with Raff, and Rich took vocals with Joe.  Then after finding out another band had the legal rights to the name Linus, the next thing for them to do was change their name.
                        Going through band names such as CL2 and 718, they had decided on the name Rise.  After they settled on Rise, they decided to start working on original material.  Very simple and easy structured songs were made such as "Set It Off" and "Rage" to an emo-freestyle relaxing "Upper Class" and then playing cover songs from Deftones to Indecision.  As they were starting to progress, they had found out that the name Rise was taken by another band that had the legal rights for it.  So once again they needed to look for a new name.  From suggestions like Flu Season, the band decided to make it "____ Season" but in the meantime decided to call themselves Season and then they got used to it and it just stuck.
                        Playing a good amount of originals and cover songs and having a band name that wasnt already taken by someone else, the next thing they felt they needed was to start playing some shows.</p>
